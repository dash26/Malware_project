Dataset split is 60 - 40

1. alexnet - 
97.7% accuracy after changing learning rate.
Has issues as it predicts all the benigns as malwares

2.densenet121 (best one hands down)
98.87% accuracy after changing learning rate.
predicts everything properly

3.VGG16
98.52% accuracy after changing learning rate.
predicts everything properly

4.Mobilenet_V2
98.35% accuracy after changing learning rate.
predictions are horrible apart from the lolyad1,2,3 families, by far the worst model might be overfitting 

5.restnet34
98.61% accuracy after changing learning rate.
predicts everything properly, except one benign file.
